                        Social Sphere is a concept for an online educational platform, where youth workers can learn how
                        to
                        use various social media sites, in order to connect easily to the youth.
                        <br><br>
                        The main features of the platform will be learning lessons, completing quests, and acquiring
                        rewards, certificates of mastery after every finished course, option to choose specific social
                        media
                        or have an archetype. Currently, based on our research findings, the 4 included social media
                        platforms are Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and Discord.

                    <p>
                        The majority of youth are spending significant amounts of time online, with many spending over
                        three hours a day and a significant portion of them having online contact for the entire day.
                        This means that online communication is important for reaching the youth.
                        While digital youth work, such as gaming events and programming together, is already a popular
                        activity, online youth work is still largely non-existent.
                        because of this, many youth organisations in eindhoven cannot connect to all members of their
                        target group and help them

                        An international student team collaborated with Garage2020 to create an online platform for
                        youth workers in Eindhoven. They followed the Design Thinking methodology through three phases:
                        Research, Design, and Testing.
                        <br><br>
                        The research phase involved studying youth work extensively, though time constraints led to some
                        uncertainties. Despite challenges, the research laid a solid foundation.
                        <br><br>
                        The design phase, while enjoyable, had its difficulties in finalizing the project's design and
                        selecting typefaces. Nevertheless, the team created a visually captivating platform.
                        <br><br>
                        In the validation phase, they sought feedback from stakeholders and experts to ensure their
                        project met its goals, overcoming challenges like coordinating with test participants.
                        The team faced various difficulties throughout, such as falling behind schedule and missing team
                        members. This experience taught them the importance of professional research, making suitable
                        design choices, and enhancing social skills.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, the project allowed for personal growth, emphasizing the value of teamwork and
                        resilience in tackling challenges.
